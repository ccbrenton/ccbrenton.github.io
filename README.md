## My completed projects include:
#### [Pups and Pubs - Brewery Analysis With SQL, Python, and Tableau](https://ccbrenton.github.io/project/pups-and-pubs/) 
>In this project, we explore a database full of brewery data to see what insights we can extract. At the end, we introduce a second data source to help us locate dog-friendly breweries in Michigan. We finish the project by building an interactive map of our dog-friendly breweries.
#### [DJ With Data - Spotify Music Analysis in Python](https://ccbrenton.github.io/project/dj-with-data/) 
>In this project, we identify music trends from a music playlist to help identify songs that match the same trends. We utilize a variety of python libraries and Chebyshev's inequality to complete this task.
