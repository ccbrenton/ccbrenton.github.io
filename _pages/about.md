Hello, and welcome to my data analytics portfolio!

As an engineer, data was front and center to my work. Designing anything is an iterative process between building prototypes, conducting validation tests, analyzing data, and presenting findings to stakeholders. Being an engineer is a lot more than being skilled in product innovation and high level math. Engineering also requires a deep skillset in working with data (sometimes quite a lot of data), and telling a story that communicates your results in a clear and concise way. While the greatest tool at any engineer's disposal is Excel (a tool I'm sure most are very familiar with), it quickly became apparent in my engineering journey that there was more to the world of data analytics than generic tables and simple scatter plots. I started learning the power of python and how it could be used not only for deeper customization in my analysis, but also in optimizing my workflows. I learned about Power BI and Tableau which vastly changed my perception of data viz and it's ability to make data not only easier to digest, but more engaging. I learning how to properly wrangle large datasets with structured databases and SQL. I also learned about machine learning and it's use as a powerful predictive tool when flooded with data variables. Overtime, I started to notice the growing overlap between what it means to be a good engineer and a good data analyst.

Today, I continue that journey as I pursue ever-growing expertise in data analytics. This portfolio highlights the growth of my skillset as I apply a variety of data analytics tools and strategies to personal datasets I find interesting. The beautify of data analytics is the ability to obtain insights into the world around you using these findings to make informed decisions. Sometimes data analysis findings is just something fun to learn, but other times it can provide profound insights that can lead you to whole new ideas and directions. That's what makes data analytics fun AND rewarding.
